WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the 
eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and 
then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated 
followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.
